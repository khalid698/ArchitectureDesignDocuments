**Proposed Technical Architecture for Near Real-Time Analytical Dashboard on Azure**

---

## **1. Architectural Overview**

To achieve near real-time visualization of bank transactions from a REST API to a ReactJS-based dashboard deployed on Azure, the architecture leverages Azure's robust data engineering and real-time communication services. The design ensures scalability, reliability, security, and low latency, aligning with the requirement of updating the dashboard within **5 seconds** of new transactions.

## **2. Architectural Components**

### **1. Data Ingestion Layer**

- **Service:** **Azure Functions**
  - **Type:** Serverless Compute
  - **Trigger:** **Timer Trigger**
  - **Function:** Periodically poll the REST API to fetch new bank transactions.
  - **Frequency:** Configured to run at intervals ensuring updates within 5 seconds (e.g., every second).

### **2. Data Processing and Event Streaming**

- **Service:** **Azure Event Hubs**
  - **Type:** Managed Event Ingestion Service
  - **Function:** Acts as the central event streaming platform to ingest and buffer transaction events.
  - **Features:** High throughput, low latency, scalable partitions.

- **Service:** **Azure Stream Analytics**
  - **Type:** Real-Time Data Stream Processing
  - **Function:** Processes incoming transaction events from Event Hubs, performs filtering, aggregation, and transformation as needed.
  - **Output:** Publishes processed events to **Azure SignalR Service**.

### **3. Data Storage Layer**

## **3. Data Flow & Real-Time Update Mechanism**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - **Azure Functions** with a **Timer Trigger** periodically call the REST API to fetch new bank transactions.
   - Retrieved transactions are published as events to **Azure Event Hubs**.

2. **Event Streaming and Processing:**
   - **Azure Event Hubs** ingests the transaction events in real-time.
   - **Azure Stream Analytics** subscribes to **Event Hubs**, processes the events (e.g., filtering, aggregation), and forwards the processed data to **Azure SignalR Service**.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Simultaneously, **Azure Functions** or **Stream Analytics** can write the transaction data to **Azure Cosmos DB** for persistence and historical analysis.

4. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - **Azure SignalR Service** manages WebSocket connections with the ReactJS frontend.
   - Processed transaction updates are pushed to the connected clients via **SignalR**, ensuring the dashboard reflects changes within the desired latency.

5. **Frontend Update:**
   - The **ReactJS Dashboard** receives real-time updates through the **SignalR** connection.
   - The UI dynamically updates visualizations and data displays to reflect the latest transactions without requiring manual refreshes.

## **5. Key Considerations**

### **1. Scalability**

- **Azure Event Hubs** and **Azure SignalR Service** are highly scalable, handling large volumes of events and concurrent connections seamlessly.
- **Azure Functions** can scale out automatically based on the event load, ensuring the ingestion and processing layers can handle spikes in transaction volume.

### **2. Latency**

- The data flow from ingestion to frontend is optimized to maintain end-to-end latency within 5 seconds.
- **Azure Stream Analytics** processes events in real-time, and **SignalR** ensures immediate push of updates to the dashboard.

### **3. Reliability and Fault Tolerance**

- **Azure Event Hubs** ensures durable storage of events with high availability.
- **Azure Functions** and **Stream Analytics** offer built-in retry mechanisms and error handling.
- **Azure SignalR Service** provides reliable message delivery to connected clients.

### **4. Security**

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** secures API endpoints and SignalR connections through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Data in transit is encrypted using TLS, and data at rest in **Azure Cosmos DB** is encrypted by default.
- **Azure Key Vault** can manage sensitive information like API keys and connection strings.

### **5. Monitoring and Observability**

- **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** provide end-to-end visibility into the systemâ€™s performance, enabling proactive detection and resolution of issues.
- **Azure Log Analytics** aggregates logs from all services for comprehensive analysis and troubleshooting.

### **6. Cost Optimization**

- Utilize **Azure's Consumption-Based Pricing** for serverless components like **Azure Functions** and **SignalR Service** to optimize costs based on actual usage.
- Implement auto-scaling policies to ensure resources are used efficiently.
