**Solution Design for Analytics Platform**

---

### **Executive Summary**
This document outlines the proposed architecture for an analytics platform designed to meet the requirements of a trading application. The platform will enable the ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization of data, supporting both batch and real-time scenarios. By leveraging Azure technologies, the solution ensures scalability, flexibility, and performance to meet current and future business needs.

---

### **Project Goals**
1. Implement a scalable solution to handle data ingestion from on-premises Oracle databases and real-time event streams.
2. Store data in a centralized, cost-effective, and analytics-ready format.
3. Process raw data to generate meaningful insights through batch and real-time processing.
4. Provide robust visualization capabilities for pre-defined and custom reports using Power BI or custom applications.
5. Ensure data governance, security, and performance optimization across all layers of the architecture.

---

### **Architecture Overview**
The solution comprises the following components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Tools to fetch data from on-prem Oracle databases and real-time event streams using Azure Data Factory and Event Hub.
2. **Data Storage**: Azure Data Lake as the central repository for raw and processed data.
3. **Data Processing**: Batch and streaming processing using Azure Synapse Analytics and Databricks.
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards and reports using Power BI or custom web-based applications.
5. **Optimization**: Scalability and performance enhancements with partitioning, compression, and auto-scaling mechanisms.

### **Data Ingestion**
**Tools**:
1. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**:
   - Use to connect to the on-prem Oracle database.
   - Set up Integration Runtime for secure data movement.
   - Utilize scheduled pipelines to pull data in near real-time or batch mode.

2. **Azure Event Hub**:
   - If the application writes event messages, Event Hub will be used to capture and stream data in real-time.
   - Event Hub Capture will store event data directly into Azure Data Lake.

3. **Azure Stream Analytics** (Optional):
   - Used for real-time transformation and ingestion of streamed data from Event Hub into Azure Data Lake.

---

### **Data Storage**
**Storage Options**:
1. **Azure Data Lake**:
   - Serves as the central repository for both raw and processed data.
   - Raw data will be stored in formats such as JSON or Avro.
   - Processed data will be stored in optimized formats such as Parquet or Delta for analytics.
   - Folder structure will logically partition data based on time or other relevant dimensions.

**Example Folder Structure**:
```
/raw/
   /streaming/
       /YYYY/MM/DD/HH/
   /batch/
       /YYYY/MM/DD/
/processed/
   /transactions/
       /YYYY/MM/DD/
```

### **Data Processing**
**Batch Processing**:
1. **Azure Data Factory Pipelines**:
   - Scheduled pipelines will orchestrate the processing of raw data.

2. **Azure Synapse Analytics**:
   - Use Dedicated SQL Pools for ETL workflows and analytics-ready data storage.
   - Scheduled notebooks or stored procedures will be used for batch processing and generating derived data points.

3. **Azure Databricks**:
   - For complex transformations or machine learning, Databricks will process raw data and store results in Azure Data Lake or Synapse.

**Streaming Processing** (Optional):
- Use **Azure Stream Analytics** or **Databricks Structured Streaming** to process and store streamed data in near real-time.

---

### **Data Visualization**
**Options**:
1. **Power BI**:
   - The primary visualization tool for creating enterprise dashboards and reports.
   - Directly integrates with Synapse Analytics and Data Lake.
   - Support for canned reports and enabling users to create custom reports.
   - Licensing: Power BI Pro for individual users or Power BI Premium for enterprise needs.

2. **Custom Applications**:
   - Develop custom web-based applications using tools like D3.js, Plotly.js, or other JavaScript libraries for tailored visualizations.
   - Host on Azure App Service or Azure Static Web Apps.

---

### **End-to-End Data Flow**
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Raw data fetched from Oracle databases via ADF or streamed via Event Hub.

2. **Storage**:
   - Raw data stored in Azure Data Lake in JSON or Avro format.
   - Processed data stored in Azure Data Lake in Parquet or Delta format.

3. **Processing**:
   - Batch pipelines (Synapse, ADF, or Databricks) process and transform raw data into analytics-ready formats.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Power BI connects to Synapse for dashboards and reports.
   - Optionally, custom applications visualize data for specific use cases.

---

### **Scalability and Optimization**
1. **Data Lake**:
   - Partition data logically to improve query performance.
   - Use compression formats like Parquet to reduce storage and processing costs.

2. **Synapse Analytics**:
   - Use Materialized Views, Partitioning, and Dedicated SQL Pools for optimized performance.

3. **Power BI**:
   - Utilize Power BI Premium for larger datasets and enterprise scalability.

4. **Event Hub**:
   - Scale ingestion based on event throughput.

---

### **Summary**
This solution design provides a comprehensive architecture for ingesting, storing, processing, and visualizing data in a trading application. The combination of Azure tools ensures flexibility, scalability, and performance to meet business needs. The platform enables real-time insights, efficient batch processing, and robust visualization options tailored to end-users.
