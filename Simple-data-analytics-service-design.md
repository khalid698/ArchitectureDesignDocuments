Design a **simple, cost-effective data analytics service** that leverages Oracle's native capabilities without the need for expensive third-party tools. 
Below is a comprehensive proposal tailored to your scenario:

## **Scenario Recap**

- **Microservices:** 2
- **Databases:** Each microservice has its own Oracle database.
- **Reports:** Less than 5, based on data from both databases.
- **Constraints:** Use Oracle for the analytics database; avoid expensive tools.

## **Proposed Solution Overview**

1. **Centralized Analytics Oracle Database:** A dedicated Oracle database to store consolidated data for reporting.
2. **Data Integration Using Oracle Database Links:** Utilize Oracle’s built-in database links to fetch data from the source databases.
3. **Materialized Views or Scheduled ETL Jobs:** Create materialized views for real-time or near-real-time reporting or use scheduled ETL scripts for periodic data consolidation.
4. **Reporting Tools:** Use Oracle’s native reporting tools (e.g., Oracle BI Publisher) or other cost-effective tools like Microsoft Excel connected to Oracle for generating reports.

## **Detailed Architecture and Steps**

### **1. Centralized Analytics Oracle Database**

- **Setup:** Provision a separate Oracle database instance dedicated to analytics. This ensures that reporting activities do not interfere with the operational performance of the source databases.
- **Schema Design:** Design schemas that mirror the necessary tables from the source databases or create a star schema optimized for reporting.

### **2. Data Integration Using Oracle Database Links**

Oracle Database Links allow one Oracle database to access objects (like tables and views) in another Oracle database seamlessly.

#### **Steps to Set Up Database Links**

1. **Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the analytics database can communicate with both source databases over the network.
   - Configure necessary firewall rules and Oracle Net Services (TNS) to facilitate connectivity.

2. **Create TNS Entries:**
   - On the analytics database server, configure the `tnsnames.ora` file to include service names for both source databases.
   
   ```plaintext
   SOURCE_DB1 =
     (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = source_db1_host)(PORT = 1521))
       (CONNECT_DATA =
         (SERVER = DEDICATED)
         (SERVICE_NAME = source_db1_service)
       )
     )
   
   SOURCE_DB2 =
     (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = source_db2_host)(PORT = 1521))
       (CONNECT_DATA =
         (SERVER = DEDICATED)
         (SERVICE_NAME = source_db2_service)
       )
     )
   ```

3. **Create Database Links:**
   - Connect to the analytics database as a user with the necessary privileges.
   
   ```sql
   -- For Source Database 1
   CREATE DATABASE LINK source_db1_link
   CONNECT TO source_user IDENTIFIED BY source_password
   USING 'SOURCE_DB1';

   -- For Source Database 2
   CREATE DATABASE LINK source_db2_link
   CONNECT TO source_user IDENTIFIED BY source_password
   USING 'SOURCE_DB2';
   ```

   - **Security Considerations:**
     - Use dedicated users with read-only access to the necessary tables in source databases.
     - Store credentials securely and restrict access to database links.

### **3. Data Consolidation in Analytics Database**

Depending on the freshness requirements of your reports, you can choose between **Materialized Views** or **Scheduled ETL Jobs**.

#### **A. Using Materialized Views**

Materialized Views (MVs) store the results of a query physically and can be refreshed periodically or on demand. They are ideal for scenarios requiring up-to-date data without complex ETL processes.

##### **Creating Materialized Views**

1. **Define the Materialized View:**

   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_report_mv
   BUILD IMMEDIATE
   REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
   AS
   SELECT 
       o.order_id,
       o.order_date,
       c.customer_name,
       p.product_name,
       o.quantity,
       o.total_price
   FROM 
       source_db1_link.orders o
   JOIN 
       source_db2_link.customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
   JOIN 
       source_db2_link.products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - `BUILD IMMEDIATE`: The MV is populated immediately upon creation.
     - `REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND`: Enables incremental refreshes when explicitly invoked.

2. **Scheduling MV Refreshes:**
   
   - Use Oracle's **DBMS_SCHEDULER** to automate the refresh process based on your reporting needs (e.g., nightly, hourly).

   ```sql
   BEGIN
     DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
       job_name        => 'REFRESH_SALES_REPORT_MV',
       job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
       job_action      => 'BEGIN DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH(''sales_report_mv'', ''FAST''); END;',
       start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
       repeat_interval => 'FREQ=HOURLY; INTERVAL=1',
       enabled         => TRUE,
       comments        => 'Job to refresh sales_report_mv every hour'
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

   - **Customization:** Adjust the `repeat_interval` as per the required data freshness.

3. **Advantages of Using MVs:**
   - **Performance:** Faster query responses since data is precomputed.
   - **Simplicity:** Leverages Oracle’s native capabilities without external tools.

4. **Considerations:**
   - **Storage:** Consumes additional storage in the analytics database.
   - **Maintenance:** Ensure that MVs are kept in sync with source data, especially after schema changes.

#### **B. Using Scheduled ETL Jobs**

If Materialized Views do not meet specific requirements or if you prefer more control over data transformation, you can implement simple ETL scripts using PL/SQL or Oracle’s SQL*Plus.

##### **Implementing ETL with PL/SQL**

1. **Create Target Tables in Analytics Database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE sales_report (
       order_id      NUMBER,
       order_date    DATE,
       customer_name VARCHAR2(100),
       product_name  VARCHAR2(100),
       quantity      NUMBER,
       total_price   NUMBER
   );
   ```

2. **Develop ETL Scripts:**

   - **Data Extraction and Loading:**
   
     ```sql
     BEGIN
       -- Clear existing data
       DELETE FROM sales_report;
       
       -- Insert consolidated data
       INSERT INTO sales_report (order_id, order_date, customer_name, product_name, quantity, total_price)
       SELECT 
           o.order_id,
           o.order_date,
           c.customer_name,
           p.product_name,
           o.quantity,
           o.total_price
       FROM 
           source_db1_link.orders o
       JOIN 
           source_db2_link.customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
       JOIN 
           source_db2_link.products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
       
       -- Commit the transaction
       COMMIT;
     END;
     /
     ```

3. **Scheduling ETL Jobs:**

   - Similar to Materialized Views, use **DBMS_SCHEDULER** to automate the ETL process.

   ```sql
   BEGIN
     DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
       job_name        => 'ETL_SALES_REPORT',
       job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
       job_action      => '
         BEGIN
           DELETE FROM sales_report;
           INSERT INTO sales_report (order_id, order_date, customer_name, product_name, quantity, total_price)
           SELECT 
               o.order_id,
               o.order_date,
               c.customer_name,
               p.product_name,
               o.quantity,
               o.total_price
           FROM 
               source_db1_link.orders o
           JOIN 
               source_db2_link.customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
           JOIN 
               source_db2_link.products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
           COMMIT;
         END;',
       start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
       repeat_interval => 'FREQ=HOURLY; INTERVAL=1',
       enabled         => TRUE,
       comments        => 'ETL job to populate sales_report table every hour'
     );
   END;
   /
   ```

4. **Advantages of Using ETL Jobs:**
   - **Flexibility:** Greater control over data transformations and error handling.
   - **Customization:** Ability to implement complex business logic during data loading.

5. **Considerations:**
   - **Complexity:** Slightly more complex than using Materialized Views.
   - **Performance:** May require optimization for larger datasets.

   FROM 
       source_db1_link.orders o
   JOIN 
       source_db2_link.customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
   JOIN 
       source_db2_link.products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
   ```

3. **Schedule MV Refresh:**

   ```sql
   BEGIN
     DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
